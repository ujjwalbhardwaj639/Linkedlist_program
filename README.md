## Introduction

Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink as needed. This flexibility makes linked lists suitable for scenarios where dynamic data structures are required.

The programs in this repository demonstrate various operations and algorithms that can be performed on linked lists, including:

- Creating a linked list
- Inserting elements into a linked list
- Deleting elements from a linked list
- Searching for an element in a linked list
- Reversing a linked list
- Sorting a linked list
